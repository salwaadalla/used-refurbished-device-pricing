# used-refurbished-device-pricing

** Overview:

This project aims to develop a dynamic pricing strategy for used and refurbished phones and tablets using machine learning techniques. The project was conducted for ReCell, a startup in the used device market, to analyze data and build a linear regression model to predict the price of pre-owned devices and identify factors influencing their pricing.

** Business Context:

The used and refurbished device market has experienced significant growth in recent years, driven by increasing demand for cost-effective alternatives to new models. ReCell recognized the potential in this market and sought an ML-based solution to develop a dynamic pricing strategy for their products.

** Objective:

The objective of this project was to analyze data on used and refurbished devices and build a linear regression model to predict their prices. Additionally, the project aimed to identify factors that significantly influence the pricing of pre-owned devices.

** Data Description:

The dataset used in this project contains various attributes of used and refurbished phones and tablets, including brand name, operating system, screen size, camera specifications, memory capacity, battery capacity, release year, days used, and normalized prices. The data was collected in 2021 and provided insights into the characteristics of pre-owned devices and their pricing.

** Recommendations:

The project yielded several key findings and recommendations for ReCell:
The developed model explained ~84% of the variation in the data and demonstrated good predictive performance.
Factors such as RAM capacity, camera specifications, release year, and connectivity options significantly influence the pricing of pre-owned devices.
Marketing efforts should emphasize the longevity of pre-owned devices and their gradual reduction in price over time.
ReCell should focus on attracting sellers of newer devices with good camera resolutions and consider expanding into other used gadget markets.

** Future Directions:

Potential future directions for this project include:
Collecting additional data on customer demographics to gain better insights into customer preferences.
Expanding the product range to include other used gadgets, such as smartwatches.
